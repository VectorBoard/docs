# Core Concepts

## Introduction to RAG

RAG, or Retrieval-Augmented Generation, is a methodology that enhances machine learning models by combining generative and retrieval-based aspects.

## Importance of Good Embeddings

Good embeddings are vital for the successful execution of RAG applications. They serve as the basis for retrieving contextually relevant information.

## How Vectorboard Helps

Vectorboard simplifies the complex task of optimizing these embeddings by providing a structured framework for running experiments.
