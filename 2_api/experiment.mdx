description: 🎯 The `Experiment` Class in Vectorboard
---

Meet the `Experiment` class—the heart of your RAG and LLM optimization journey. This class takes care of running individual experiments and logging key metrics like run time and embedding time. Let's dive right in!

## 🎨 Attributes

### `params` (dict)

A dictionary containing experiment parameters. This is where you set what you want to experiment with.

### `index` (int)

An integer representing the index of the experiment. Useful for keeping track when you're running multiple experiments.

### `documents` (list)

A list of documents to be used in the experiment. You can feed it directly or via a `Loader`.

### `vectorstore_list` (list)

A list of vector stores used in the experiment. Think of it as your embedding database.

### `retrievers_list` (list)

A list of retrievers used in the experiment. These are the wizards fetching relevant info from your vector stores.

### `chain` (object)

An object representing the chain used in the experiment. Could be any supported type like `RetrievalQA`.

### `query_results` (dict)

A dictionary containing the results of your queries. Data goldmine!

### `run_time` (float)

Time it took to run the experiment, in seconds.

### `embedding_time` (float)

Time it took to embed the documents, in seconds.

## 🛠 Methods

### `__init__`

Initializes an Experiment object. This is where the magic starts! 🎩

```python
def __init__(
    self,
    params,
    index=0,
    documents=None,
    vectorstore_list=None,
    retrievers_list=None,
    chain=None,
):
    ...
```

### `run()`

Runs the experiment with the given evaluation queries and returns a tuple containing the query results, the run time, and the embedding time.

```python
Copy code
def run(self, eval_queries):
...
```

### `_evaluate()`

A private method that actually does the evaluation of your experiment. Called internally by run.

```python
def _evaluate(self, chain, eval_queries):
...
```

## 💡 Example Usage

Here's a simple example to get you started:

```python
from vectorboard.experiment import Experiment

# Initialize the Experiment

exp = Experiment(
params={"chunk_size": 300, "vector_store": FAISS, "embeddings": OpenAIEmbeddings()},
index=1,
documents=my_documents,
)

# Run the Experiment

results, run_time, embedding_time = exp.run(eval_queries=["What is RAG?", "Explain LLM"])
```

And voila! You've just run your first Vectorboard experiment! 🎉
