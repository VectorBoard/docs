We're not just coding here; we're crafting the future of RAG and LLM optimization! 🚀 Here's a sneak peek at what's cooking:

## Currently in the Works

### 🛠 More Types of Search

We get it; life's too short for manual hyperparameter tuning. That's why we're ramping up to support even more search types.

### 🌈 Diverse Chains Support

LLMChain and custom chains are in our pipeline. Because, hey, variety is the spice of life!

### 🛠 Eval Tools and Metrics

We're on it! Expect robust evaluation tools to quantify your success.

### 🌌 See Your Data Differently

We're spicing up our visualization tools to give you an X-ray vision into your embedding spaces.

## Future Plans

### 🌀 Async Experiments

Because your time is precious. Run `Experiments()` in parallel and get your results, like, yesterday.

### 💻 Going Beyond Python

Heads up, JS and TS enthusiasts! We're extending our magic to other languages.

### 🔍 Perfecting the Recall

Improving embedding quality via fine-tuning and human feedback. Because good enough is just not in our vocabulary.

### 📦 Share, Don't Hoard

Easier data sharing's on the horizon with new serialization formats for embedding collections.
